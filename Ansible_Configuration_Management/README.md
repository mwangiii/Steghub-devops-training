Today, our project focuses on automating tasks using **Ansible** to enhance our understanding of **DevOps** tools. By leveraging Ansible, we’ll simplify many routine processes like setting up servers and installing software, while gaining experience writing code in **YAML**.

We’ll also introduce the concept of a **Jump Server** (or **Bastion Host**), which acts as a secure intermediary server providing access to internal networks. This ensures that our web servers within a private network remain protected from direct internet access, improving overall security.

In this project, we’ll develop Ansible scripts to simulate using a **Jump Box/Bastion Host** for securely accessing our web servers. Let’s dive in and get started!
